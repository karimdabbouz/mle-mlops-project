# MLOps Project

I built a different evidently service which takes in single predictions via the webservice and stores them in a Postgres db. Once there are enough samples (set to 50 rows), evidently will create a report and store it in another Postgres table. The idea is to continually create reports while new predictions are being made. The reference data used for the reports is stored in a GCS bucket and re-generated from the training data with each new training run via `/training/train.py`. This is triggered by pull requests to the main branch. I did this mainly because I didn't manage to fully understand how Flask+Prometheus middleware work and it felt better working on this than just copy-pasting the lessons from the last week together tbh. It's also a good idea (or necessary?) to store the predictions somewhere and neither the webservice nor the evidently service from last week do this afaik.

I have deployed both Grafana and Prometheus. The Prometheus alert is working and it also triggers since it cannot reach the webservice. The webservice itself is working however, so it must be a Prometheus config issue. I have two data sources for Grafana, one for Prometheus and one for the Postgres db where the evidently reports are being stored. The Postgres db is hosted on GCP and I've tried setting up the connection via the public IP but Grafana can't query the table. I don't know what the issue here is.

If I had more time I would fix this.
